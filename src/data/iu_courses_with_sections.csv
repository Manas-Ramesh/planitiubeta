EDUC-M 427,SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENT TEACHING SEMINAR,1–6 credits,,"This online seminar has been developed for candidates in the Teaching All Learner's (TAL) program as they bridge knowledge of theory with practice in student teaching while in special education placements.  M427 is a complementary seminar to M420 student teaching seminar with the Office of Clinical Practices.  TAL candidates will be in M420 during their general elementary education placement and in M427 during their special education placement.  The M427 seminar will be structured for fall and spring semesters and align with candidate' student teaching in special education in the local area (within a 60 mile area around Bloomington).

The content of M427 will be closely aligned with the current M420 student teaching seminar when candidates are completing their teacher performance assessment (edTPA).  TAL candidates will have a choice to complete the edTPA during the special education placement or during the general education placement.   M427 will also integrate content standards from Council for Exceptional Children (CEC Standards, 2012) for collaboration.  Collaboration standards will be addressed in each seminar (M420 and M427).  
 
The content for M427 will vary depending on whether candidates are completing the Special Education edTPA in this semester.  For this reason M427 will offer two tracks candidates must follow to successfully complete the seminar M427 edTPA Track or M427 non-edTPA Track.  The edTPA must be successfully completed in either M427 or M420.","Summer, Fall","Class #: Open | Regular Academic Session

SPH-K 405,EXERCISE AND SPORT PSYCHOLOGY,3 credits,,"Having knowledge of the behavioral factors which contribute to participation in sport and exercise activities is necessary for those interested in professions within this context.  This three credit course will involve a broad survey of the field of sport psychology and exercise and health behavior.  Although a major thrust of American sport psychology involves the application of techniques intended to enhance athletic performance, this course will also cover subjects in the area of exercise and health behavior, such as the influence of exercise on mental health, and public health policy in regards to adherence to physical activity.  Topics such as the psychology of coaching in sport and exercise/health programming will be evaluated in order to determine best practices for application to solve contemporary issues such as the growing concern of stress and the associated health issues within contemporary environments, such as the workplace.  Comprehension of this material will be synthesized into possible interventions which promote prevention and positive lifestyle behaviors. Traditional topics in sport psychology will also be discussed, such as the relationship between anxiety and athletic performance and the purported benefits of anxiety reduction techniques  But because there is a widespread lack of empirical evidence to support their use, there will be a strong emphasis on important issues in sport psychology, as well as exercise and health behavior research; drawing attention to credibility, professionalism and the utility of this field.  Ultimately, the material covered in this course will improve the knowledge of sport and health professionals in regards to these issues.  This  will better able those in these professions (and the public) to discriminate in judging the value and usefulness of information and applications in sport psychology and exercise and health behavior.","Spring, Summer, Fall","Class #: Closed | TuTh

SWK-S 141,INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL WORK,3 credits,,"This course is an introduction to the profession of social work and the philosophical, societal, and organizational contexts within which professional social work activities are conducted.  This course provides the opportunity for students to explore their interest in and potential for a career in social work.  It introduces the knowledge, skills and values of social work as a profession and explores the role of social workers within the broad area of social welfare and social services.  Social work practice requires extensive knowledge about the human condition, problems in living, problem solving, the delivery of human services, and the institutions that comprise today's social welfare system.  Cognitive and interaction skills necessary for competent practice are introduced in this course.  This course emphasizes the value base of social work practice and its commitment to social and economic justice.  It assists students in assessing the congruence between their own values and those of the profession.  The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the accrediting body for School's of Social Work, requires Social Work Programs to demonstrate how each course in the curriculum helps students develop competencies expected of all who seek entry into the profession.  Programs must document a match between course content and CSWE competencies defined in Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS).  This course contributes to building knowledge and skills for students to demonstrate the following CSWE competencies: EPAS 2.1.1 (identify as a professional social worker and conduct oneself accordingly), EPAS 2.1.2 (values and ethics), EPAS 2.1.3 (critical thinking), EPAS 2.1.4 (engage diversity and difference in practice), EPAS 2.1.5 (advance human rights and social and economic justice), EPAS 2.1.6 (research informed practice) and EPAS 2.1.9 (respond to contexts that shape practice).  Introduction to Social Work (S141) is one of seventeen social work courses required for the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree.  Students who seek admission to the BSW degree program must complete this course prior to applying to the Indiana University School of Social Work.  As this course introduces students to knowledge pertaining to the characteristics, functions, and requirements of the social work profession, it prepares those formally admitted to the BSW degree program for further study in the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary for effective generalist social work practice.","Spring, Summer, Fall","Class #: Open | MW

SWK-S 221,HUMAN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT,3 credits,IUB GenEd S&H credit (166),"This course assists the undergraduate social work student in building a foundation for understanding human behavior and development in diverse contexts across the life course. The course emphasizes the interdependence of dynamic interactions between a person and that individual's environment, and thus introduces students to implications for human development through a person-in-environment lens. S221 Human Growth and Development in the Social Environment explores influences of the biological, social, cultural, psychological and spiritual dimensions on individual human development and behavior. Students examine how the diverse contexts in which individuals live impact the range of human development and behavior in themselves and others. Understanding human behavior and development from a multidimensional perspective builds a strong foundation for development of skills later in the curriculum. Specifically, foundational concepts presented in this course help students apply critical thinking to an understanding of the diversity of human functioning and implications for the processes of social work assessment, evaluation and intervention. The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the accrediting body for School's of Social Work, requires Social Work Programs to demonstrate how each course in the curriculum helps students develop competencies expected of all who seek entry into the profession. Programs must document a match between course content and CSWE competencies defined in Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS). This course, required in the BSW curriculum, draws upon basic knowledge and understanding of our diverse society. Course content contributes to building knowledge and skills for students to demonstrate EP 2.1.2 (apply social work ethical principles to guide professional practice); EP 2.1.4 (engage difference and diversity in practice); and, EP 2.1.7 (apply knowledge of human behavior and the social environment. S221 Human Growth and Development in the Social Environment serves as the first of three courses in the Human Behavior in the Social Environment sequence within the curriculum. The courses should be taken in sequence or concurrently.","Spring, Summer, Fall","Class #: Open | TuTh

SWK-S 507,"DIVERSITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE",3 credits,,"This course will introduce MSW students to human rights and social justice perspectives in order to examine the shifting landscape of diversity, oppression, power, and privilege. The fundamental goal of the course is for students to develop critical consciousness in order to gain competencies to address diversity, privilege and oppression in social work practice.  The importance of power and the dynamics of domination and subordination in multiple manifestations of oppression, particularly among historically oppressed groups, will be explored.  An understanding of these concepts integrated with an understanding of one's self within these systems is essential for social work practice. This course will employ a practice framework that integrates 1) a human rights perspective promoting the dignity, respect, and well-being of all persons; 2) a social justice perspective aiming to understand and ameliorate oppression, unequal access to resources, and social inequities; 3) and diversity and cultural humility, which requires critical self-evaluation and self-awareness in order to address power and privilege and to develop respectful cultural sensitivity. Students will utilize this practice framework to address social injustice through analysis, self-reflection, and peer collaboration. The course will serve as a transformational space for students and instructors to cultivate and exercise cultural humility when exploring how multiple identities shape our beliefs, assumptions, biases, behaviors, and life experiences. It will challenge and deconstruct assumptions within theories and research methodologies relevant to social work in order to understand the dynamics that manage and sustain oppression at individual and institutional levels. This course will examine how oppression and intersectionality affect service delivery at micro and macro levels, and how a human rights framework integrated with cultural humility ameliorates social injustice and promotes culturally responsive services. This course will promote students' career-long process of fostering cultural humility and applying an understanding of human rights, diversity, and oppression to their practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, communities, and society.","Spring, Summer, Fall","Class #: Open | M
